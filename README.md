## Compare two movies' Production Crew

### Usage

To use, simply enter two movies (or just one, if you want, but I don't know why you would) into the text boxes, and hit Go. That's it.

This project was created using Tailwind CSS. This was my first time trying to make _anything_ with Tailwind, so further cleanup may be required. I'll attend to it as I add features.

### Deploy Locally

To deploy locally, clone the project nagivate to the project directory, and run

`npm install` followed by `npm start`

### To-Do

- Add a Cast tab on top of the page for easy switching between Cast and Crew

- Clean up the code

- Add a Modal/Popup when a crew is clicked, which shows the Crewmember's Public Profile alongside a comparison of who they have collaborated with the most.
